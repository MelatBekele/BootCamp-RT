# Matplotlib Homework - The Power of Plots

Overall comment 
Cleaning up the data helped in removing duplicates that would have affect the over all report. 
Barchart displayed the spread or Regimen that was used per the Tumor volume. It showed how the data was spread in the sampling. 
Using the Pie chart to display the gender distribution to show the distribution of data among the Sexs give high light on the how 
many were from the same gender. In the Pie chart i was able to see the Distribution was almost the same. 

For Calculation for the IQR and quantitatively to determine if there are any potential outliers showed an outlier on Regimen "Infubinol". We might need to remove the outlier, to show the spread of data.
The correlation and regration information highlighted there is positive relation where both move in the same direction.

Over all the project gave insight on the distribution of the dataset and how the collected data was distributed.
